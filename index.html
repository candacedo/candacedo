                <h2>about</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a master's student at Georgia Tech studying Aerospace Engineering, specializing in Space Systems.
                    I am inspired by the stars and human exploration of the unknown, and my dream is to design and build spacecraft to explore our solar system and the greater universe. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in the greater Seattle area, but I've lived in a variety of places for work and school, including Austin, Los Angeles, central New Jersey, and now Atlanta!
                </p>
            
                <h2>research experience</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently a graduate researcher in Dr. Glenn Lightsey's research group in the Space Systems Design Lab. I am working on integration and test 
                    for the <a class='olink' href = 'https://ssdl.gatech.edu/index.php/research/projects/visors-virtual-super-resolution-optics-using-reconfigurable-swarms' ref = 'ssdl.gatech.edu/index.php/research/projects/visors-virtual-super-resolution-optics-using-reconfigurable-swarms'>VISORS</a>
                    mission, to be launched in 2025.
                    I am supported by the <a class='olink' href = 'https://www.nsfgrfp.org/' ref = 'www.nsfgrfp.org'>NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program</a>
                     and the <a class='olink' href = 'https://www.aauw.org/resources/programs/fellowships-grants/current-opportunities/selected-professions-fellowships/' ref = 'www.aauw.org/resources/programs/fellowships-grants/current-opportunities/selected-professions-fellowships'>AAUW Selected Professions Fellowship</a>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my undergraduate senior year, I conducted independent research in the <a class='olink' href = 'https://tigersats.princeton.edu/' ref = 'tigersats.princeton.edu'>TigerSats Lab</a> at Princeton. I designed and built a prototype of a <a ref = "assets/cdo-thesis.pdf" href = 'assets/cdo-thesis.pdf' class = 'olink'>mission-agnostic, open-source PocketQube platform</a>.
                    This prototype will serve as a satellite bus for future PocketQubes in TigerSats and other universities. During Spring 2023, I designed, built, and tested a <a ref = "assets/shaker-table-report.pdf" href = 'assets/shaker-table-report.pdf' class = 'olink'>CubeSat-scale shaker table</a>,
                     which is capable of performing sine-vibration testing for small systems (up to 2 kg). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During Fall 2022, I was an undergraduate researcher at the <a class='olink' href = 'https://irom-lab.princeton.edu/' ref = 'irom-lab.princeton.edu'>Intelligent Robot Motion Lab</a>. 
                    I worked on a <a ref = "assets/irom-report.pdf" href = 'assets/irom-report.pdf' class = 'olink'>project</a> 
                    to demonstrate absolute depth estimation capabilities using monocular cameras for small FPV drones. 
                    I have also conducted research at the <a class='olink' href = 'https://spacephysics.princeton.edu' ref = 'spacephysics.princeton.edu'>Space Physics Lab</a> related to ion beam calibration testing. 
                </p>

                <h2>work experience</h2>
                <p> 
                    During Summer 2024, I interned on the Starlink Power Systems Hardware team at <a class='olink' href = 'https://www.spacex.com/' ref = 'spacex.com'> SpaceX</a>.
                    I primarily focused on several test campaigns for the solar array team, including light-induced degradation testing, proton radiation testing, and validation of the solar array power model. 
                    I also had the opportunity to design several brackets for the flight vehicle. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During Summer 2023, I interned on the spacecraft vehicle design team at <a class='olink' href = 'https://rocketlabusa.com' ref = 'rocketlabusa.com'>Rocket Lab</a> 
                    as part of the <a class='olink' href = 'https://www.matthewisakowitzfellowship.org/' ref = 'https://www.matthewisakowitzfellowship.org/'>Matthew Isakowitz Fellowship Program</a>.
                    At Rocket Lab, I designed a volume and mass simulator for a large commmunications satellite, and designed a variety of smaller parts for ground testing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During Summer 2022, I was a spacecraft avionics intern at <a class='olink' href = 'https://firefly.com' ref = 'firefly.com'>Firefly Aerospace</a>. 
                    I worked on projects related to the Blue Ghost lunar lander including test campaigns, qualification testing software, and PCB design and manufacturing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also held a variety of teaching and tutoring roles, including at the Art of Problem Solving, PrepNorthwest, Berkshire Test Prep, and as a private tutor.
                </p>

                <h2>for fun!</h2>
                <p>
                    I co-led <a class='olink' href = 'https://rockets.princeton.edu' ref = 'rockets.princeton.edu'>Princeton Rocketry Club</a>'s Spaceport America Cup team in 2022-23. 
                    We competed in the 30K COTS division at the 2023 competition in Las Cruces, NM, and successfully launched our rocket to a predicted altitude of 32,000 ft. Unfortunately, due to a GPS malfunction, we were unable to recover the rocket. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than aerospace activities, I also enjoy cooking for friends, hiking in the PNW, playing badminton, and playing Stardew Valley!
                </p>
